    # More Info on the model ðŸ¤”
    - Using the **Skyroam Technical docs** sent over by Theja, I created mappings of the categories and subcategories using ChatGPT.
    - Combined with the **"subject" metadata** filled by the agents, this was used for checking the clustering approach.
    - I used **OpenAI's GPT-3.5** model to extract the customer complaint from the conversations in the dataset, and fed that into the model
    to predict the category and subcategory.
    - This would be **superhelpful as a starting point in generating the training dataset** for the topic modeling module where we could train **one of the 
    opensource LLMs** to be able to do this task eliminating our dependency on the ChatGPT model.
